# Sapphire SDK
 
This mod is the internal representation of **Sapphire SDK**. You can customize Sapphire's settings through this mod.

## About

**Sapphire** is a [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/) mod loader and modding SDK with a modern approach towards mod development. Unlike previous mod loaders, which merely inject the DLLs and let devs handle the rest, Sapphire aims to be a more comprehensive project, which manages loaded mods & hooks itself. Sapphire has been built to ensure compatibility, portability and ease of use while retaining performance. For devs, Sapphire means easy development and portability; for end users, Sapphire means an uniform and easy experience using mods.
